/**
 * Remembering where somebody put their panels.
 *
 * Two levels, and the relationship between them is the point:
 *
 * - **The default** is the layout every project starts from.
 * - **A project entry** is written only once you arrange *that* project.
 *
 * A project with no entry follows the default *live*. So changing your default
 * moves every project you have never personally arranged, and "Reset layout"
 * deletes a project's entry rather than writing the default into it — it goes
 * back to following rather than being frozen at today's copy of it.
 *
 * `localStorage`, not `.shipstudio/project.json`. That file is inside the
 * repository and holds what the *project* has (its hosting link); a pane width
 * is something a *person* has, and committing one would push your arrangement
 * onto everyone who clones the repo. It also puts this beside every other panel
 * preference the workspace already keeps — floating positions, floating sizes,
 * Team's per-project open flag.
 *
 * Every read is guarded and every write is best-effort: a private window, a
 * browser with site data blocked, or a full quota costs the preference and
 * never the workspace.
