/**
 * The decision the global `unhandledrejection` handler makes, extracted from
 * `src/main.tsx` so it can be tested without booting the app.
 *
 * `main.tsx` is the last line of defence for a promise nobody caught. It has
 * three jobs and they are easy to confuse: suppress third-party plugin noise,
 * suppress one known Tauri runtime race, and — the part this module exists
 * for — refuse to file a bug report for an error the *backend already said
 * was not a bug*.
 *
 * A `CommandError::Expected` is a recognized environment state with a
 * user-side fix (a folder that was moved, a PTY that already exited, a plugin
 * whose files are gone). It crosses IPC as `{ type: 'Other', expected: true }`
 * precisely so the frontend can tell the difference. Every *local* catch site
 * has had to learn that one at a time; this handler never did, so any
 * fire-and-forget `void invoke(...)` that rejected Expected was auto-filed as
 * a malfunction (issue #916, and the repeat telemetry behind #923).
 *
 * @module lib/globalErrorFilters
