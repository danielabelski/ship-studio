/**
 * Who else is in this repo, in the workspace header.
 *
 * The smallest thing that makes a project stop feeling like a room you are
 * alone in. Faces, ordered by who moved most recently, with a count of what
 * has landed since you last looked.
 *
 * It is not presence and does not pretend to be: no green dots, no "active
 * now". Every avatar here is someone with a branch that has actually moved,
 * which is the only thing a git remote can tell us and — usefully — the thing
 * people are really asking when they ask who is around.
 *
 * Built on `ToggleButton` with `className="workspace-panel-toggle"`, exactly
 * like Agent, Elements, Variables and Comments beside it. It was briefly a
 * hand-rolled `<button>` with its own borders and hover rules, which is the
 * per-domain button class CLAUDE.md rules out — and it showed, because it sat
 * in a row of five controls and was the only one whose pressed and hover
 * states did not match.
 *
