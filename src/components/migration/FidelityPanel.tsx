/**
 * Fidelity — the panel that makes "it still looks like the site" checkable.
 *
 * The old `webflow-to-code` plugin ended at a markdown brief. Nothing in it
 * ever compared the result to the original, which meant the one property a
 * migration is judged on was the one property nobody measured. This panel is
 * the other end of that: a number per template per breakpoint, the picture
 * that produced each number, and the record of the loop that moved them.
 *
 * The loop it reports on is:
 *
 *     build → compare → fix → compare → …
 *
 * and the agent drives it. The panel is where a person checks on it, decides
 * the remaining gap is acceptable, or spots that the fix at 1440 broke 767.
